## Fitbit Projects


This contains all of my fitbit projects.

## Notes
- I used the command line interface instead of fitbit studio
	- The server starts on your PC when you start up fitbit shell, so once you use `npx fitbit` make sure to connect your device to the server before using `bi`
- There were a lot of errors that came up, and I resolved them with the help of google/fitbit discussion boards
- My device, the Fitbit Versa 2, is a bit older and I'm not getting updates for it for some reason - you're supposed to update through your phone, and it doesn't come up automatically, and you can't check for updates - so I'm being forced to use an older version of the SDK `4.1.0`, and because it doesn't work with newer verisons of node, I'm using node version `16.0.0`
